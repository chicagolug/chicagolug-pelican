Linux 3.8-rc5
=============
:author: Linus

Hey, Linux 3.8-rc5 is out, so go get it.

I'll be traveling for LCA next week, so I'm hoping things are quieting
down. They did not quiet down much for rc5, though, we still had 300+
commits in this rc.  Not that they look all that scary, but there's more
movement in btrfs, f2fs, ptrace and module loading than I'd really
prefer at this stage.

Sure, there's also the usual driver updates - i915 and radeon, usb,
serial, yadda yadda. But the drivers actually accounted for less than
half of the patch this time around.

Go forth and test.
