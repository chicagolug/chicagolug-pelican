It's the much-awaited exclusive LCA release, but with no mascot changes
this time. It's not huge, but I really want -rc7 to be smaller, and will
be soundly cursing at anybody who sends me pull requests for things I
don't think are worthy.

There are some x86 and networking updates, with sound and exynos GPU
driver changes showing up too. And various stuff in random other
subsystems (pinctrl, regulator, iommu, nfs, dm/md..).

You know the drill.
