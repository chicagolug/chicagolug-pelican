====================================
:author: Greg KH

As Linus points out, I haven't been announcing all of the recent stable
kernel releases here, my fault, sorry.  Chalk it up to a vacation
hangover combined with the inbox from hell...

Anyway, I've now just released the following stable kernels, for those
of you to scared to be running the -rc kernels, there should be
something for everyone here: 

- 3.0.60
- 3.4.27
- 3.7.4

Go and start rebuilding, and as always, have fun.
