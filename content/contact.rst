Mailing List
------------

If you want to get in touch with members of the ChicagoLUG, the best way to
do so is by joining our mailing list. Our `discussion list`_ is what we use to
plan meetings, let each other know about related technology events, and discuss
other free/libre and open source software matters. If you're new to the group,
please join the list and introduce yourself.

If you want to know some of the prior history of the group, you can also view
read-only, archived posts from our legacy `Google Group`_.

Social Media
------------

If you want to keep up to date with our various goings-on via social media,
follow any of our social media accounts:

- `Identi.ca`_  (powered by `pump.io`_)

- `Meetup.com`_

- `Twitter`_

Jabber/XMPP
-----------

We maintain our own XMPP server, and it is open to public registration. You can
get an account with *username@chicagolug.org* by using the *register a new*
*account* feature of your jabber client. Our server supports SSL encryption
between client and server, and betweeen servers. OTR encryption is supported if
your client supports it.
