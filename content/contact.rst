Mailing Lists
-------------

If you want to get in touch with members of the ChicagoLUG, the best way to
do so is by joining one of our mailing lists. We have two of them: 

- A `discussion list`_ - This is the main list. We use it to plan meetings &
  get-togethers, let each other know about related technology events, and
  discuss whatever else we think group members may want to know about.

- An `announcement list`_ - This is a lower-traffic list. New posts are
  limited to announcements of ChicagoLUG meetings and events. Join this list
  if you only want to know when our next meeting will be held.

If you're new to the group, please join the `discussion list`_ and introduce
yourself. Tell us what drew you to the group or what you hope to get out of
it. If there's some aspect of Linux or Free and Open-Source software that you
find particularly interesting, feel free to share that with us, as well.

Our mailing lists are fairly new, so if you want to know some of the history
of the group, you can also view read-only, archived posts from our legacy
`Google Group`_.

Social Media
------------
