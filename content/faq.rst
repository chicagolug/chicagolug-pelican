When is your next meeting?
--------------------------
All of our meetings and events are listed on our `Meetings`_ page.

I'm new to the group. How can I get involved?
---------------------------------------------
The best way to get involved is just to show up at one of our meetings or
events. From there, you can either speak at a future meeting, or you can 
suggest a meeting or event of your own.

I'm having trouble with my Linux installation. Can you help me?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Most likely, yes. We typically have some time before or after our regularly
scheduled meetings that is dedicated for hacking, and you can bring your
computer to the event and request help. It's best if you let us know of your
problem ahead of time, though.

Also, feel free to bring up any particular issues on our mailing list. We're
a pretty knowledgeable group, and should be able to help you find the
resources you need to fix your problems.

I'm interested in giving a talk at an upcoming meeting. What do I need to do?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The best way to secure a speaking slot at an upcoming meeting is to suggest
your talk topic on our mailing list. Although we're a Linux user group, we
welcome talks around most any aspect of Free and open-source software.

I missed one of your talks? Are talk recordings available somewhere?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of our meetings are recorded, but most are not. We'll be making videos
and slides of prior talks available soon.

I'm recruiting for some Linux-related positions. How can I get in touch with members of your group?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We welcome announcements of job openings on our mailing list as long as the job
opening is related to Linux and Linux-related systems or devices.
