When is your next meeting?
--------------------------
All of our meetings and events are listed on our `Meetings`_ page.

I'm new to the group. How can I get involved?
---------------------------------------------
The best way to get involved is just to show up at one of our meetings or
events. From there, you can either speak at a future meeting, or you can 
suggest a meeting or event of your own.

We also recommend that you join our `mailing list`_. It is a relatively
low-traffic list, but helps facilitate member interaction.

I missed one of your talks. Are talk recordings available somewhere?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of our meetings are recorded, but most are not. Any videos are available
in the Videos section of our `GNU Mediagoblin instance`_.

I'm recruiting for some Linux-related positions. How can I get in touch with members of your group?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We welcome announcements of job openings on our `mailing list`_. Kindly be
respectful of our groups' interests and make sure that any job opening that you
share is related to Linux or Linux-related systems / devices.

I'm having trouble with my Linux installation. Can you help me?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Most likely, yes. We typically have some time before or after our regularly
scheduled meetings that is dedicated for hacking, and you can bring your
computer to the event and request help. It's best if you let us know of your
problem ahead of time, though.

Also, feel free to bring up any particular issues on our mailing list. We're
a pretty knowledgeable group, and should be able to help you find the
resources you need to fix your problems.
