:summary: This is a CryptoParty! We're going to be discussing the basics of cryptography and data security techniques, so bring your ideas and questions!

Members of the Chicago LUG are participating in a Cryptoparty following our
regularly scheduled meeting on Saturday, December 15th. The Cryptoparty will
run from 3:00pm to 7:30pm at Free Geek Chicago, 3411 W. Diversey Avenue. (We'll
be car- or bus-pooling to the Crypto Party following our previously-scheduled
event at Pumping Station: One.) 

The event will focus on the basics of cryptography and data security
techniques, so bring your ideas and questions!

An RSVP for the Cryptoparty is required, and space is limited. As of the time
of this posting, about 10 more spaces available, so please RSVP to
brandoniamsmith@gmail.com to hold your spot. If you want to send the event
leader an encrypted mail before the event, you can do so at
hey@brandonsmith.com. His public key is on the keyserver at keys.gnupg.net, or
you can just ask him and he'll send it to you..

We recommend bringing a few dollars as a suggested donation to Free Geek
Chicago (the hosts of the event), and to cover the cost of pizza, but no one
will be turned away for inability to pay.
