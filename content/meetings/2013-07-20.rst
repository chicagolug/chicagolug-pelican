:summary: William Giokas will be giving a talk on the rolling release distribution, Arch Linux. Though William will provide an overview of Arch in general, he'll also give special attention to the Arch Linux package manager, pacman.
 
We've scheduled our July meeting for Saturday, July 20th, starting at 12:00pm at 
`Pumping Station: One`_. Early birds typically start showing up by about 11:40
or so. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

`William Giokas`_ will be giving a talk on the
rolling release distribution, `Arch Linux`_. Though William will provide an
overview of Arch in general, he'll give special attention to the Arch Linux
package manager, *pacman*.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel free
to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the `GNOME Foundation`_, but
it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake of
pizza and drinks.
