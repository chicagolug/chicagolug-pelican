:summary: October meeting of the Chicago GNU/Linux User Group

We've scheduled our October meeting for Saturday, October 12, starting at
2:30pm at `Pumping Station: One`_. All are welcome.

Speaking Topics
---------------

Freddy Martinez of `Radicals Against Discrimination`_ will be giving a talk on
personal data security. Jim Campbell will be following-up Freddy, leading a
discussion around how we want to use new cloud server resources that have been
generously offered to us by a hosting provider.

Hacking
-------

As per usual, several of us will also hack on GNOME-related projects, but feel
free to bring whatever project that you want to work on.

If you need help with setting-up or fixing your computer, please let us know
in advance so that we can plan accordingly.

Foodstuffs
----------

Some funds for food and drink are supplied by the `GNOME Foundation`_,
but it's typically a good idea to bring a few dollars if you want to partake
of pizza and drinks.
