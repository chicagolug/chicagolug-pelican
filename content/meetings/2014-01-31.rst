We've scheduled a Casual Project Night for this Friday, January 31st, starting
at about 6:30pm. If you can't make it at that time, feel free to stop by later.
We'll be there throughout the evening.

We'll be meeting at `New Wave Coffee`_ in Logan Square. Hope to see you
there, but if you can't, we'll update our blog with how things went, and you
can catch us the next time.
