:summary: The Flourish Conference promotes the use and adoption of Free Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) by demonstrating the practical applications of FLOSS in the business and academic world.

Members of ChicagoLUG will be participating at `Flourish`_, an open-source
conference organized by students at the University of Illinois at Chicago. This
year's event will take place on Saturday, April 5th, `at the UIC Campus`_.

The `conference schedule`_ is pretty packed. If you have
some breaks between sessions, though, stop by the `Mini-Expo`_. We'll have a
booth there, and it would be great if you'd stop by and say hello.
