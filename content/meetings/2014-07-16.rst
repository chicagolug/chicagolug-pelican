:summary: The initial session of biweekly co-learning sessions dedicated to preparing for a Linux-related certification

We're organizing a series of group sessions around certification prep, and
this will be our initial session. We'll be meeting at the Lincoln Park
`Whole Foods`_ on Wednesday, July 16th at 6:30pm. We anticipate that this
session will run until about 8:00-8:30.

Meeting Agenda & Request for RSVP
----------------------------------

As this is our first session, we'll be discussing each members' interests
in pursuing a certification, assessing our collective level of skill, and
deciding what certifications we want to pursue.

Space is limited, so please RSVP on our `meetup page`_ so we know who will be
attending.
