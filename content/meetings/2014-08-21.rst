:summary: Join fellow LinuxCon and Chicago GNOME enthusiasts for *GNOME Beers: LinuxCon Chicago Edition*. GNOME Beers is a globe-spanning initiative to get GNOME folks together around a pint or two. For our GNOME Beers event we'll be getting together at Howell's & Hood, a restaurant and pub located just a short walk from the LinuxCon hotel.

If you've had a full day of talks at LinuxCon, and want to unwind with some
friendly locals and good conversation, we've got just the spot. Join some
Chicago GNOME'rs for *GNOME Beers: LinuxCon Chicago Edition*.

What is GNOME Beers?
--------------------

People in different cities organize *GNOME Beers* events to get people
together to talk about GNOME. The events often feature lightning talks, but
folks will probably be Linuxed-out after a full day at LinuxCon, so no
lightning talks for us.

When and Where Will GNOME Beers Take Place?
--------------------------------------------

    We'll be getting together on Thursday, August 21st at 7:00pm.  The location
    is set as `Howells & Hood`_, a restaurant and pub at 435 North Michigan

    Howells and Hood is about `a two-block walk`_ from the LinuxCon hotel.
