Following-up on Ryan's "Open Platforms," discussion, Jim Campbell will be
presenting on GNU MediaGoblin internals. We'll have a look at what is new with
the 0.8 release and our ChicagoLUG instance of the platform.


Foodstuffs
------------

We will have food! Probably pizza! At least a few of us typically bring some
beverage to share, as well. We're a community-run organization, so we
recommend bringing a few dollars if you'd like to partake of the food. No one
will be denied a slice of tasty pizza for inability to chip-in, though.
