:summary: Let's do Programming Tonight - January Edition!  Join us at New Wave Coffee in Logan Square for late January coffee and hacking.

Join members of the ChicagoLUG for informal hacking and coffee drinking at
*Programming Tonight: January Edition*. Bring a project to work on and a
few dollars for some coffee and a tasty sandwich. Get   to know your fellow
LUG members in an informal, working session.
 
The gathering is set for Friday, January 29th, starting at 7:00pm. We'll be
meeting at `New Wave Coffee`_, located at `2557 North Milwaukee Avenue`_.
   
You're welcome to bring any project that you'd like, or to bring no project at all
and hope to find one once you get there.
