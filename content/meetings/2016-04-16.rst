|efftux| On Saturday, April 16th, members of the Chicago GNU/Linux User Group along with
`Shahid Buttar`_ from the `Electronic Frontier Foundation`_
will co-host a free workshop on surveillance self-defense.  The workshop will
be open to the public, though particularly structured for activists and lawyers
who support social movements.

You are not expected to be a technical expert to attend this session - it is
geared towards regular smartphone and laptop users. We will be sharing
knowledge of surveillance, some immediate and practical steps you can take to
protect your communications, and how to work with neighbors to influence
surveillance policy at the state and local level.

To get the most out of the event, we recommend that you bring your phone and/or
laptop.

The event will take place at `SPACE`_, located at `444 N. Wabash Ave`_ in downtown
Chicago. The session will start at 11:00am, and will last approximately four
hours. We recommend that you take public transit to attend the event. SPACE is
conveniently located near the Grand Avenue stop on the CTA Red Line, and is
wheelchair accessible. Pizza and other refreshments will be served.

There is no cost to attend, but we encourage (though not require) that you RSVP
so that we may plan accordingly. And feel free share this event, too!
Registrations are handled `via the EFF website`_. We look forward to seeing you
on April 16th!

Special Notes

Legal professionals licensed to practice in Illinois will have an opportunity to receive Mandatory Continuing Legal Education (MCLE) credit for a $25 cost.

We will have vegetarian food options available. If you prefer a vegan, gluten free, or other food option, please send an email to tux@chicagolug.org with
