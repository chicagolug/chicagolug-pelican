Pelican

:category: News

Welcome to the reworked kernel.org website. We have switched to using
Pelican_ in order to statically render our site content, which
simplifies mirroring and distribution. You can view the sources used to
build this website in its own `git repository`_.

Additionally, we have switched from using gitweb-caching to using cgit_
for `browsing git repositories`_. There are rewrite rules in place to
forward old gitweb URLs to the pages serviced by cgit, so there
shouldn't be any broken links, hopefully. If you notice that something
that used to work with gitweb no longer works for you with cgit, please
drop us a note at webmaster@kernel.org.
