/pub tree resync-ing
====================

:category: Site news

Due to a failure in one of the rsync scripts during the maintenance
window, the mirrors of /pub hierarchy on www.kernel.org got erased. We
are resyncing them now from the master storage, but in the meantime you
will probably get an occasional "Forbidden". The entirety of the archive
should be rsync'ed in a few hours.

We apologize profusely for the problem and will fix the script to make
sure this doesn't happen again.

Contents of git.kernel.org are unaffected.
