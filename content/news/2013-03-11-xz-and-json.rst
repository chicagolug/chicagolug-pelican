XZ by default and JSON
======================

:category: News

We've implemented two oft-requested features today:

1. The download links now default to .tar.xz versions of archives
2. There is now a JSON file with the release information located in
   https://www.kernel.org/releases.json. If you've been screen-scraping
   the front page, please use this instead.

If you have any other feature suggestions, please send them to
webmaster@kernel.org.
