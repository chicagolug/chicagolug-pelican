Fifty shades of Tux
===================

Special thanks to Beno√Æt Monin for donating a MIT-licensed CSS theme to
the kernel.org project to replace the one we hastily put together.
Though the Pelican authors have since obtained a free-license
commitment from the copyright owners of the CSS files shipping with
Pelican, we wanted to have something that looked a bit less like the
default theme anyway.

If anyone else wants to participate, full sources of the kernel.org
website are available from the `git repository`_.
