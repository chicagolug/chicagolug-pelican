Good-bye bzip2
--------------
We started listing xz-compressed versions of kernel archives in all our
announcements back in March 2013, and the time has come to complete the
switch. Effective immediately, we will no longer be providing
bzip2-compressed versions for new releases of the Linux kernel and other
software. Any previously released .tar.bz2 archives will continue to be
available without change, and we will also continue to provide
gzip-compressed versions of all new releases for the foreseeable future.

So, from now on, all releases will be offered as both .tar.gz and
.tar.xz, but not as .tar.bz2. We apologize if this interferes with any
automated tools.

Happy new year!
---------------
Happy new year to all kernel.org users and visitors. The Linux
Foundation and Linux Kernel Archives teams extend their warmest wishes
to you all, and we hope that 2014 proves to be just as awesome (or
awesomer) for the Linux kernel.
