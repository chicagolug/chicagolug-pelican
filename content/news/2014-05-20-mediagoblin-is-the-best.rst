We've recently started using `GNU MediaGoblin`_ to `host our photos and
presentation slides`_, and we really, really like it.

       Gavroche, the MediaGoblin mascot, helps us display our media.

It doesn't hurt that one of our LUG members, `Chris Webber`_, is the founder of
the GNU MediaGoblin project, but I think we'd still be using it to host our
media even if he wasn't the founder of the project.

A One-Stop Shop
---------------

The thing with MediaGoblin is that you can use it to host most anything. Sure,
for the time being, something like Flickr or Google Photos might give you
some kind of better visual experience, but can you use either of those
services to host your photos *and* presentations? What about music? Video,
too?  All on the same site?

MediaGoblin *can* do all of that, though. And more. It can host 3-D Printing
schemas, and word on the street is that they're also working on podcasting
support. That's right - you could host your podcasts, music, baby photos, 
and a PDF of your Masters Thesis all on the same site. You can do it. If you
want to.

MediaGoblin isn't at 1.0 yet - they still have some features that they want to
add. The biggest feature on their list is for *federation*. Federation will
allow different MediaGoblin instances to talk to each other, turning your media
hosting site into a more involved media sharing site.

Free Software, DIY
------------------

MediaGoblin is Free software. It's a part of the `GNU project`_, so it respects
your freedom in the sense that your media is up there for you and your friends
to see and share, and isn't up there so that an unknown media analytics
company can count all of your clicks and sell those clicks to people who pay
to know that you clicked on something.

That freedom comes with a bit of a price, though. That price is that you
either need to host MediaGoblin yourself, or you need to know of someone who
hosts an instance where you can get an account. We host our instance on the
graciously provided `Rackspace`_ cloud, but you can host instances on most any
kind of hardware.

It also means that, if you make changes to the MediaGoblin source code, you
need to be willing to share those changes with others. MediaGoblin is
licensed under the `GNU Affero General Public License Version 3.0`_ license,
so you need to be willing to share with others what has been shared with you.

You Can Do It
-------------

If you're interested in setting up your own instance of MediaGoblin, just drop
us a line on our `mailing list`_, or send us a `tweet`_. We can help get you set up.
If you're interested in learning more about MediaGoblin, check out their
`website`_, or join them on IRC. Any of us would be glad to hear from you, and
would be glad to help you get started.

Happy Goblin-ing.  :)
