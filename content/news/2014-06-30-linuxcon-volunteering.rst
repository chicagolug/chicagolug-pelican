Volunteer Opportunities at LinuxCon North America
-------------------------------------------------

In case you hadn't heard, `LinuxCon North America`_ is in Chicago this year.
The event is set to take place August 20-22nd at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers
alongside the Chicago river in Streeterville.

Organizers from both the Linux Foundation and the Free Software Foundation
have been in touch with the LUG with regards to some volunteer opportunities,
and we wanted to share them with the larger community.

The Linux Foundation: Volunteer as a Session Host
-------------------------------------------------

The Linux Foundation are seeking volunteers to assist with being Session
Hosts at LinuxCon + CloudOpen.

This would be for the main days of the conference, Monday, August 20 through
Wednesday, August 22. They need around 14 volunteers, as well as someone to
help manage the schedule (making sure people arrive, etc.).

Volunteers would assist on two of the days of the conference and enjoy the
third day as an attendee.

As a Session Host volunteer, you would get a free pass to the conference, be
able to choose the breakout room that you want to monitor so that you can
hear content that interests you, as well as go to the rest of the conference
events.

Here is a breakdown and more information:

* Based on `the schedule`_, each volunteer would pick one room, and would be
  Session Host for that room during the event.
* There are a few other events that need to be monitored that are not
  necessarily a breakout session
* Work two days of the conference and enjoy the third as an attendee
* Volunteers would also be invited to partake in meals and evening events

The Free Software Foundation: Volunteer as a Booth Representative
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Free Software Foundation is also seeking volunteers to work at the FSF
booth during the conference. You can volunteer for as little as a two-hour
slot during the event, and you would answer questions about the Free
Software Foundation.

Interested?

If you're interested in either of these opportunities, get in touch with the
LUG through our `mailing list`_ or any of our social media channels. We'll
then get you in touch with folks from the Linux Foundation and/or Free
Software Foundation. Thanks!
