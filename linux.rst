What is Linux?
--------------
Linux is a clone of the operating system Unix, written from scratch by
Linus Torvalds with assistance from a loosely-knit team of hackers
across the Net. It aims towards POSIX and `Single UNIX Specification`_
compliance.

It has all the features you would expect in a modern fully-fledged Unix,
including true multitasking, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand
loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management, and
multistack networking including IPv4 and IPv6.

Although originally developed first for 32-bit x86-based PCs (386 or
higher), today Linux also runs on a multitude of other processor
architectures, in both 32- and 64-bit variants.

New to Linux?
-------------
If you're new to Linux, you don't want to download the kernel, which is
just a component in a working Linux system. Instead, you want what is
called a distribution of Linux, which is a complete Linux system. There
are numerous distributions available for download on the Internet as
well as for purchase from various vendors; some are general-purpose, and
some are optimized for specific uses. We currently have mirrors of
several distributions available at http://mirrors.kernel.org/.

Note, however, that most distributions are very large (several
gigabytes), so unless you have a fast Internet link you may want to save
yourself some hassle and purchase a CD-ROM with a distribution; such
CD-ROMs are available from a number of vendors.


Mailing lists
