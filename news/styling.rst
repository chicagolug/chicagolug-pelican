Cleanroom styles
================

:category: Site news

You are probably wondering what happened to the site's look.
Unfortunately, we've been alerted that the default theme shipped by
Pelican (which we largely adapted) has an unclear license. Until this is
cleared up, we've put together a quick-and-dirty cleanroom CSS
reimplementation that preserves the functional aspects of the site, but
sacrifices a lot of the bells and whistles.

If you are a CSS designer and would like to donate your own cleanroom
style, please let us know at webmaster@kernel.org.

Our apologies, and we promise to keep a keener eye on licensing
details of various templates distributed with open-source products.
